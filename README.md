# Kickstarter Analysis
### Time of Project: Spring 2019
### Statistics Capstone Project
### Bachelors of Science in Statistics, Texas A&M University

For this project, my classmates and I analyzed Kickstarter data found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects). Our goal was to develop predictive models to answer various hypotheses. Specifically, we utilized logistic and linear regression models to test hypotheses relating to the probability of success based on the type of project and funding goal, along with other factors. Please see the [Kickstarter Final Report](https://github.com/iscarff123/KickstarterAnalysis/blob/main/Kickstarter%20Final%20Report.pdf) for more details about our methodologies.
